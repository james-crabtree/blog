        <p class="blog-text">
          One thing I’ve learnt from bootcamp is that the life of a developer
          seems to be about 5% being confused beyond belief, 5% actually coding,
          and 90% debugging and fixing problems in your code. Because of that
          there has been A LOT of times throughout bootcamp where I’ve been
          working both solo and collaboratively where bugs and problems have
          arisen and have been needed to be addressed and fixed.
        </p>
        <br />

            myself.</strong
          >
          <br />
          An example of a time I encountered something in my solo code that
          wasn’t working was a recent project, my personal project - which I
          made an online painting application for. One of the core features of
          the app was the ability to click on one of the different colored divs
          that was on top of the page and by clicking it, it would change the
          color of the “paint brush”.
          <br />
          <br />
          At first I put in code that I thought was going to work and achieve
          the result that I wanted, safe to say that it didn’t achieve what I
          wanted it to and it spilled out a console full of errors. At this
          point I just read through each individual error message one by one and
          fixed them hoping it would fix it. Ultimately though, that didn’t fix
          it so I went over to an old friend, ChatGPT, and asked it to help me.
          After MANY questions and MANY different changes to the code, I still
          couldn’t get the feature working. Ultimately the next day I talked to
          a few of my course mates to get their take on it and see what they had
          to offer but ultimately I wasn’t able to get the feature working.

          While I do not remember the complete exact details, when I was working
          in a pairing with Matt on the broken kaleidoscope challenge (the one
          with a bunch of colored pixels), when we first wrote our code for the
          pixels, the randomly colored pixels weren’t showing up and instead we
          were just getting a white page.
          <br />
          <br />
          Both Matt and I first discussed the problem and provided each other
          with ideas on what the problem could potentially be. The next thing we
          did was look back through our code, immediately we went and looked at
          our array that we were calling to get all the different pixels. Upon
          doing a few different things that I believe didn’t work, we then asked
          for help from one of the facilitators so that we could move on and
          progress to the next steps in the challenge, and not fall to far
          behind and waste to much time trying to solve just one problem.
