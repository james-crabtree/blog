        <h2 class="blog-text">FEEDBACK REFLECTIONS: My journey with feedback</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            Giving and receiving feedback is a skill that has been taught to us extensively over our time at bootcamp - as it is an 
            essential and highly useful skill to be good at, not just in the professional workplace but also just in your day to day 
            personal life. Most of the times I’ve given or received feedback during bootcamp has been during or after a group project or 
            pair programming session.

            Initially giving feedback was a very strange task for me, it’s not something I have really extensively done at all during my 
            life and it felt very weird giving people feedback. As time went on though and I did it more and more (and especially after 
            the human skills deep dive on feedback), I became more and more comfortable with giving feedback. One time I remember well 
            about giving feedback was after a pair programming session with Matt. Near the end of the day I was feeling very tired and 
            fatigued and Matt just went straight in and took the lead of the pair programming, to give me a chance to relax a bit. I 
            wanted to make it very clear to him how good that was and so that is something I brought up to him in my feedback for him, so 
            he knew just how much I appreciated it.
          </p>
            <br>

          <p class="blog-text">
            Truthfully, taking feedback is not something I used to be overly amazing at. I would always listen to what feedback people had 
            to give me, but a lot of the time I would just ignore it, or totally forget all about it about 10 minutes later. This is 
            something I’ve made a very conscious effort in changing at bootcamp since all feedback I’m given will help my learning and 
            help me improve. A specific feedback was back in one of my first pairings, I was new on campus and quite nervous, my partner 
            told me to not worry about messing up or not to worry about looking stupid and to just dive in and learn. This is feedback I 
            took on with me for the rest of my time on bootcamp and I haven’t been worried about looking stupid or messing up ever since.
