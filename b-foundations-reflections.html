        <h2 class="blog-text">WEEK 5: Foundations reflections.</h2>

        <p class="blog-text">
              <!-- QUESTION 1-->
        <h3 class="blog-text">What are three new things you have learnt about yourself and your ego due to the core learning?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          First thing I've learnt is that throughout my entire life I have pretty much NEVER practiced or used self reflection, so when it came to parts
          in the core learning curriculim that involved self learning, there were times where I really struggled.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          Another thing I learned, though I already knew about it a bit, was that my attention span and ability to focus on stuff is completely and
          utterly horrendus and is absolutely something I need to work on and something that I need to develop methods around to be able to keep it 
          under control and be able to focus for longer periods of time.
        </p>
          <br>

        <!-- QUESTION 2 -->
        <h3 class="blog-text">What are the role of values, empathy, and self-awareness in learning and programming?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I think the role of values in learning and programming plays the exact same role that they do in your whole day to day life, because it my 
          mind the values that you follow in your day to day life should reflect on everything you do, this includes learning and programming.
        </p>  

        <p class="blog-text">
          I think the role of empathy in learning and programming involves being kind to yourself, understanding that things are not always going to
          go right, things will go wrong and when they do you shouldn't be to hard on yourself because everyone makes mistakes, even the greatest
          programmer in the whole world make mistakes.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          I think the roles of self-awareness in learning and programming is knowing what you can and can't do. In programming terms it's about knowing
          what stuff you can do, knowing about how big of a project you can undertake, or knowing when you can't do something so you can hand it off to
          someone who can. In learning terms self-awareness is about knowing when you are stuck, when you don't understand something and then in turn
          asking for help from others.
        </p>
          <br>

        <!-- QUESTION 3-->
        <h3 class="blog-text">What has surprised you the most about the core learning?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          The broad scope of stuff that we learned about. Before I started Dev Academy I was one of these people that thought all programmers did in
          their job (and all employers cared about) was coding, and all they needed to be was good at coding. What really surprised me was the wide
          range of stuff not related to direct programming that is important to a programmer and potential employers, such as good time management,
          dealing with pressure, self reflection skills etc.
        </p>
          <br>

        <!-- QUESTION 4-->
        <h3 class="blog-text">What were the most challenging aspects of the core learning?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I found actually taking on the advice and stuff we learned from the core learning, and actually putting it into use in my day to day life
          and also when I am coding. A lot of the stuff I learnt during the core learning are absolutely very useful things to know, but a lot of it
          is stuff that I haven't practiced or used through my life. I also found self reflection really hard, because self reflection is something I
          don't do in my normal day to day life up to this point.
        </p>

        <p class="blog-text">
          What I am trying to say is that I have already developed my own habits so I have found it a little difficult to take some of the stuff I've
          learned from the core learning and put it into practice, because some of the stuff we've learned is basically polar opposites to the habits
          I have already developed.
        </p>
          <br>

        <!-- QUESTION 5-->
        <h3 class="blog-text">Why do you think we, a programming school, are spending so much time focusing on core learning in a web development Bootcamp course?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Because having those core skills that we are being taught is something that a lot of employers in the programming/technology industry looks
          for in potential candiates to hire. Real world technology employers aren't just looking for people who can code well, with enough time and
          practice basically anyone can code well, they're also looking for people who can work efficiently, work well in a team and have good time
          management skills. This is why Dev Academy teaches us these core skills, to get us ready for work in the real world and to also make us look
          more attractive to potential employers.
        </p>
          <br>

        <!-- QUESTION 6-->
        <h3 class="blog-text">Does the time you spent studying core learning here feel like a waste of time? Should you have just used that time to practise programming instead? Justify your answer.</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          No, absolutely not. I suppose a lot of people just think that working as a programmer is all about writing code, and while that is pretty 
          true, there is a whole lot more to it than that, such as problem solving, working to strict deadlines, working in a team, and keeping your 
          cool when shit just isn’t going right. This is where the core learning comes in, knowing how to program is essential as a programmer but so 
          are the other core things so I certainly don’t think it is a waste of time to be studying the core learnings.
