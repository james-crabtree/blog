        <h2 class="blog-text">GROUP PROJECT REFLECTIONS: My three roles</h2>

          <p class="blog-text">
            Participating in group projects in weeks 2-6 at Bootcamp has been an extremely valuable experience, where I have learned a lot 
            of things, including holding numerous different roles in my groups and learning what they do and how they serve the team. My 
            roles were vibes watcher, product owner, and git keeper.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-text">
            <strong>Week 2: Vibes watcher</strong>
              <br>
            For my week 2 project I was incharge of the vibes! It was my job to make sure vibes were high, people were in a good space and 
            people were happy and enjoying themselves. For this week my group only had 3 people so that made my role as vibe watcher easier
             to undertake because of having fewer people to look out for. All in all I think I performed well in this role, it taught me a 
             lot about managing emotions and vibes in a team and taught me how important good team morale is for a project to be completed 
             to a high quality standard.
          </p>

          <p class="blog-text">
            <strong>Week 4: Product owner</strong>
              <br>
            For my week 4 project I was the product owner. Typically the product owner is the member of the team that has direct contact 
            with the client and then relays what the client wants to the scrub facilitator, who then relays that back to the remaining 
            team. Being product owner in this group project taught me a few things about the role, especially stuff about group management 
            (as the product owner also doubled as a bit of a group manager in this weeks group project). That said, I don’t feel like I 
            learnt a huge amount about the role seeing how there was no actual client involved in the project.

          <p class="blog-text">
            <strong>Week 5: Git keeper</strong>
              <br>
            For my week 5 project I was the man who was in charge of the git. It was my job to decide the layout of my teams git flow (we 
            decided to create our own branches, merge them with main once we were done, pull from main to ensure we had the most up to 
            date version, then create a new branch and start the cycle again). I was also in charge of making sure all commits and merges 
            were done safely and with no issues, and also in charge of sorting out any conflicts. I learned the most as my role of git 
            keeper than any other role as we used git throughout the entire day of the project, and I definitely finished up the day 
            feeling like I had a better understanding of git and git workflow than I had before I started the project.
