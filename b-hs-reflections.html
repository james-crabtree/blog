          HUMAN SKILLS REFLECTIONS: Personal and professional growth
        </h2>

        <p class="blog-text">
          In terms of learning, one thing I’ve learnt from doing foundations and
          bootcamp is that I am a very social person and that I learn a heck of
          a lot better when I am actually in person and working alongside
          someone else (like pair programming) or working alongside a whole
          group of people (like in group projects).
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="blog-text">
          I have developed a whole range of useful human skills while on
          bootcamp too. These include active listening, having tough and
          sometimes uncomfortable conversations with peers, ways of dealing with
          stress, and ways of being respectful towards others as well as working
          on bias of others and inclusion of others. One thing I noticed a few
          weeks back was that when I met my friend for coffee, the human skills
          I had learnt just automatically and instinctively kicked in - I was
          maintaining eye contact, not interrupting when they were talking, and
          also reciprocating back what they were saying to me to show that I was
          listening and that I was understanding what they were saying.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="blog-text">
          Learning about the practice of self compassion has had a huge effect
          on not only my learning at bootcamp, but also just in my day to day
          life as well. In the past I have been very hard on myself if I wasn’t
          understanding a topic, or if I wasn’t getting the hang of something
          quickly. The human skills taught me that self compassion is essential
          for learning and that the whole process of learning is a journey in
          which everyone takes a different time. Because of this, I have been
          able to find a lot of calm when learning new things and I haven’t
          stressed out or worried myself if I wasn’t immediately understanding
          the topic.
