        <h2 class="blog-text">HUMAN SKILLS REFLECTIONS: Learning plan reflections</h2>

        <p class="blog-text">
          Back in foundations I created a learning plan which I then revised at the start of bootcamp. Today we are nearing the end of 
          bootcamp and I am here to reflect on my learning plan and see what worked well, what didn’t work well, and what I would 
          potentially change for future learning plans.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="blog-text">
          <strong>Were there any surprises or did I learn anything new about myself?.</strong>
          <br />
          While it didn’t come as a massive surprise, I definitely learnt more about myself in the fact that I learn best when I am around 
          other people, in person and working alongside other people face to face. This was something that I had known prior to starting 
          bootcamp, but undergoing bootcamp kind of surprised me just how much better I work and learn when I’m surrounded by other people 
          face to face, and when I get the chance to work alongside other people.
            <br/>
            <br/>
            <br/>
          I suppose the burning question that everyone is waiting to be answered is, did I actually follow the stuff I laid out in my 
          learning plan? One of my plans was to be a kind and just generally nice person to be around, not be a dickhead in other words, 
          so that the campus environment is a good one. I certainly think I followed this, I’ve been kind and I think a good person to be 
          around, though admittedly there was 1 or 2 times I may have accidentally said something dickheadish - but I can live with that.
            <br>
            <br>
          I also made a commitment to get help after 10-15 minutes of being stuck on a problem, whether that is help from Google, ChatGPT, 
          a fellow student, or a facilitator. I actually think I stuck to this learning commitment really well, there were even a few 
          times where I would instantly seek help (instead of struggling for 10 minutes) just because I was aware of my limitations and 
          that the problem I was facing was something I couldn’t fix on my own at that point.
            <br>
            <br>
          I also made a commitment to take a step back and relax when stuff was getting tough, or when things were getting to me. This is 
          something I followed very well, in fact sometimes maybe there were times where I followed it to well and felt a lot more relaxed 
          than I should’ve been, or taken a bigger step back from something that was hard than I really should of.
