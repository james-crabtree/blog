        <h2 class="blog-text">CORE BLOG WEEK 4: Neuroplasicity and Growth Mindset.</h2>

        <h3 class="blog-text">What is neuroplasicity and what are the benefits of understanding it?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          According to the definition on Google when you look up neuroplasticity, it is, <em>the ability of the brain to form and 
          reorganize synaptic connections, especially in response to learning or experience or following injury</em>.
          <br>
          <br>
          Understanding neuroplasticity helps benefit people in their ability to learn new things, enhance existing cognitive abilities and learnings, 
          and can also strengthen cognitive areas where function has been lost or has declined over time. In some other cases, neuroplasticity can 
          help stroke and traumatic brain injury patients recover and improve their cognitive function. 
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class ="blog-text">How will I engage with the principles of neuroplasicity and how will it benefit me?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          That is a fantastic question there James, glad you asked me. Engaging with the principles of neuroplasticity will benefit me 
          significantly as it will help me with my journey through Dev Academy and help me learn all the new things I will be introduced to. It will 
          also help me enhance existing cognitive abilities that I already know. 
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class="blog-text">How can you improve neuroplasicity?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Some key ways to increase neuroplasticity is simply continuous practice in what you are learning and what you are trying to achieve. By 
          putting in work and practising something their neural networks shape themselves according to that activity or practice. By further shaping 
          those neural networks, you are increasing neuroplasticity.

        <h3 class="blog-text">What resource did I find useful in my research of this topic?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          A resource I found useful was <strong><a href="https://www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity-2794886">www.verywellmind.com/what-is-brain-plasticity</a></strong>. 
          I found this resource useful as it had a lot of the information that I was needing to be able to write this blog post and the information was 
          presented clearly in an easy to understand and follow manner.

        <h2 class="blog-text">Growth Mindset</h2>
        <br>
        <h3 class="blog-text">What is a growth mindset and why is it relevant?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          Growth mindset is a mindset in which you believe that you can always continue to grow your intelligence, that your intelligence level is no 
          set, or predefined, when you are born and that it is something you can grow and expand on by putting in the effort and continuing to learn 
          and push yourself. It is a way of viewing challenges and setbacks. People with a growth mindset believe that even though they may struggle 
          or not understand something initially, with enough work and effort, their skills and understanding will improve over time.
        </p>
        <br>
    
        <h3 class="blog-text">Did anything surprise me about growth mindset? How will I actually use growth mindset for myself?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          I wouldn’t say that anything from this exploration completely surprised me. I had heard of growth mindset before, though I never looked into 
          it very deeply, and I also understood from past experiences that intelligence and ability are not set in stone and are actually something 
          you can improve with patience and effort. I will use what I’ve learnt about growth mindset however in the rest of my journey through Dev 
          Academy, especially when things get tough and hard to understand, I just got to remember to keep pushing through and working hard at it and 
          it will all eventually start to make sense and fall into place.
        </p>

        <h3 class="blog-text">What resource did I find useful in my research of this topic?</h3>
        <p class="blog-text">
          A resource I found useful in my research was <strong><a href="https://www.understood.org/en/articles/growth-mindset">www.understood.org/en/articles/growth-mindset</a></strong>. 
          It had a lot of good, clear and informative information about growth mindset.
