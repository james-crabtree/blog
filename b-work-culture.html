          HUMAN SKILLS REFLECTIONS: Helping create a supportive and inclusive
          work culture.
        </h2>

        <p class="blog-text">
          A disclaimer, I have not done weekly or fortnightly reflections on
          this topic like the Trello ticket has asked, instead I am doing one
          big reflection at the end.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="blog-text">
          I have contributed to a positive, supportive and inclusive team
          culture and environment in a few ways. The first way I can think of is
          being kind to others and supporting them. I would try and check in
          with the people around me, ask them how they’re doing and listen to
          them when they responded and provided feedback and support whenever
          they wanted it or needed it. While I spent a lot of the bootcamp
          behind most other people in terms of programming knowledge and
          ability, I also tried to help people out with their coding as much as
          I possibly could when I had the opportunity.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p class="blog-text">
          Another way I contributed to a positive work culture is by just
          generally being a good person. We are very fortunate to have a really
          amazing group of people on this cohort and that is because we are all
          kind, considerate and nice to each other. One thing I strongly believe
          is that humour helps ease stress and makes an environment better to be
          around, so I tried to provide humour wherever possible and appropriate
          to help lower the stress levels of the group and to help raise the
          vibe a little bit.
