            First thing I've learnt is that throughout my entire life I have
            pretty much NEVER practiced or used self reflection, so when it came
            to parts in the core learning curriculim that involved self
            learning, there were times where I really struggled.
            <br />
            <br />
            Another thing I learned, though I already knew about it a bit, was
            that my attention span and ability to focus on stuff is completely
            and utterly horrendus and is absolutely something I need to work on
            and something that I need to develop methods around to be able to
            keep it under control and be able to focus for longer periods of
            time.

            Years ago when I was first starting coding in HTML and CSS I
            couldn’t for the life of me work out why one of my classes wasn’t
            working. It was driving me insane but eventually I found out that
            the syntax I was using was wrong, which is why it wasn’t working. To
            solve my problem I took a long hard look at the code and broke it
            down into littles pieces until I finally found the problem.
            Ultimately this incident helped me learn a good way to solve coding
            problems, by looking over the code and breaking it down into smaller
            pieces until you find the problem. It also taught me the correct
            syntax too.

            According to the definition on Google when you look up
            neuroplasticity, it is,
            <em
              >the ability of the brain to form and reorganize synaptic
              connections, especially in response to learning or experience or
              following injury</em
            >. Understanding neuroplasticity helps benefit people in their
            ability to learn new things, enhance existing cognitive abilities
            and learnings, and can also strengthen cognitive areas where
            function has been lost or has declined over time. In some other
            cases, neuroplasticity can help stroke and traumatic brain injury
            patients recover and improve their cognitive function.

            What is Javascript? If you think of HTML as the bones of the human
            skeleton, CSS as the physical features of the body, then Javascript
            is like the organs and DNA that bring the whole body to life.
            Javascript is what takes any website to the next level, makes it
            interactive, and is what takes a website from good to great.

            When you look up emotional intelligence on Google it will come up with this definition - <strong><i>“the capacity to be aware of, control, 
            and express one's emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously and empathetically”.</i></strong> But what does that 
            actually mean?
              <br>
            To put it into more simple and more understandable terms, Emotional intelligence is the ability to notice, understand and manage your 
            emotions and the emotions of others around you, like your family, friends, colleagues. There are five key elements to EI: self-awareness, 
            self-regulation, motivation, empathy, and social skills.

            My long term goal and career aspirations is to get into the tech industry, initially in the web development industry, then see where life 
            takes me. I’ve wanted to get into the tech industry for a long time because it is constantly growing, job opportunities are very high and 
            I think will continue to remain high for a long long long time, and I also think that people working in tech are typically more valued and 
            treated better by employers than in other traditional industries.

            From an outsiders perspective, classes and id’s may look the same, they essentially both do the same thing - 
            they’re both used to edit elements with CSS, but taking a deeper closer look into the two, you’ll see that their uses are 
            different to each other. To put it into simple terms, you should use a class when you plan to use it on multiple elements (like 
            on a h1, p, h3, div) while you should use an id if you are only trying to edit a specific single element.

          Like a lot of children growing up I took a lot of notice of my parents and my auntie (she visited once a year so I have spent a lot of time

          genuine people and naturally I feel like a lot of those values have rubbed off on me and helped shaped me into the person I am today, and
